   * Container methods that dispatch events are like a component's output
   * observables.  Container properties that select state from store are like a
   * component's input properties.  If pure components are functions of their
   * inputs, containers are functions of state
   *
   * Traditionally you would query the components rendered template
   * to validate its state. Since the components are analogous to
   * pure functions, we take snapshots of these components for a given state
   * to validate the rendered output and verify the component's output
   * against changes in state.
